# README

So, I'm making a rails app for a plumber.  I'm pretty excited to start another Rails app, but a little overwhelmed too.  Plumbing is a tough and competive business and I hope that I can help the guys at Paschall Plumbing to grow their business.

Things to cover:

* Ruby version: ruby 2.4.0p0 (2016-12-24 revision 57164)

* Rails version: Rails 5.0.2

* System dependencies: none

* Configuration

* Database creation: 

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* [Plumber](/plumber.md) Details
